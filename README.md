# Optimal Compressive Temporal Imaging using a Shuffled Rolling Shutter

This repository contains the code to reproduce the results presented in the paper following paper:

*N. Diaz, F. Guzman and E. Vera, "Optimal Compressive Temporal Imaging using a Shuffled Rolling Shutter," in Optics Express.

This repository aims to adaptive design the coded apertures from compressive spectral images acquired with a multisensor camera. The classification is performed using the captured compressive projections.

## Usage

This code was written using Matlab R2019b. It should be downloaded the RollingShutterCodedAperture repository
1. Download this repository via git 
```
git clone https://github.com/nelson10/RollingShutterCodedAperture.git
```
2. To run the code using either the function Mainreconstruction.mat that performs the sensing, coded aperture design, and the reconstruction using the compressive rolling shutter measurements.


## Datasets

The datasets could be download from the following [link](http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes)

The files should be placed in the Data folder of this repository.
